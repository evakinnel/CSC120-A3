Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
Laura Dreher, Gracia Bareti
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
Office Hours on Thursday AM
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
With these basic tasks, it's feeling very similar to Python to me...just I don't know the syntax for anything (but I'm learning)
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
The internet is essential and very useful if you already know the general idea. Similar to the above answer, it's pretty clear to me that if there was something I was able to do in Python/think I should be able to do, I will most likely find a way to.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Obviously, getting help was really helpful, espcially from someone who was more familiar with Java. I'm glad that I started early and was able to go to office hours to get a push to overcome an early barrier. What didn't work is that almost every issue I tried to solve took way longer than expected.
